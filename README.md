A program that should read from an altimu minimu or a LSM303 and return the position and velocity of an object relitive to it's initial position and velocity. It uses the principles dx = .5 * a * (dt)^2 + v0 * dt and dv = a * dt to calculate the velocity it reports the position and velocity through serial com with a baud rate of 9600. the results should be in the form of V: <xvel> <yvel> <zvel> P: <xpos> <ypos> <zpos>
